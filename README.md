ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gadhakleons

ðŸ§ª With a background in molecular biology and bench-based cancer research, now Iâ€™m diving into bioinformatics â€” and loving every minute of it.

ðŸ§¬ Currently working on RNA-Seq data to study B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. My research integrates transcriptomics, machine learning, and clinical data to uncover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

ðŸš€ I'm currently analyzing expression-based RNA-Seq data from a large Indian B-ALL cohort to reveal subtype-specific expression patterns, fusion events, and transcriptomic profiles â€” aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies.

ðŸ’» I work primarily in **R**, and **Unix environments**, and Iâ€™m actively learning **Python**, **Snakemake**, and **biostatistics** to enhance my workflow and reproducibility.

ðŸ”¬ Excited about data-driven discovery, reproducible pipelines, and exploring how code can solve real-world biology problems.
